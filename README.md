This is a centralized repository for all of the machine learning examples I've
implemented. Not everything I've done is here, but I'm attempting to make this
repository as clean as possible.

Each directory contains an algorithm that only depends on other code or data
present in this repository. Most of the code is written in Python and MATLAB,
and specific dependencies for each project are noted.
